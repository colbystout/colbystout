# Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! :wave:

## My name is Colby Stout, a Data Analyst from central Indiana. :corn:

After a long run working in creative arts and media, I became interested in analytics in early 2021. I discovered I really loved cleaning data and organizing visuals in Microsoft Excel. From there, I haven't stopped learning and honing my craft.

- I'm currently working on a hear failure analysis to discover trends and serious indicators in heart failure. :heartpulse:

## Tools I Use:
